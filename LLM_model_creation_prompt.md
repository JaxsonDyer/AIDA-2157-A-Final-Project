Your Target Variables (Use these as the y prediction target for specific models):

    Model 1 (Lightning Predictor): Predict Fire_Ignited using Lightning_Strike_kA and Soil_Moisture_Pct.

    Model 2 (Fire Size): Predict Fire_Classification (Minor/Moderate/Major). Notice that the script guarantees Major fires are >100 Hectares, Pine, Dry, and Windy.

    Model 3 (False Alarm Filter): Predict Is_False_Alarm (0 or 1).

    Model 4 (Containment Time): Predict Days_to_Contain (Regression).

    Model 5 (Smoke Alerts): Predict AQI_Level (Regression).

    Model 6 & 7 (Evac & Roads): Predict Evac_Triggered and Road_Closure_Flag.

    Model 8 (Landslides): Predict Landslide_Risk_Flag. (Triggers specifically when Slope > 25% and Rain > 15mm).

    Model 9 (Pre-Positioning): Predict Dispatch_Air_Tanker.

    Model 10 (Powerline Risk): Predict Powerline_Risk_Flag.
